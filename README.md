## ðŸŽ‰ About <a name = "about"></a>
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an automated teller machine (ATM) system. An ATM is a computerized machine that provides customers 
with banking services, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, funds transfers, and account inquiries. The system is designed using the object-oriented programming 
language Java and utilizes the Graphical User Interface (GUI) application. It allows customers to access their bank accounts and perform banking operations 
without the need of a bank teller. The system also includes features such as a customer database, transaction logging system, and a security system. The project 
also discusses the design process and the implementation of the system.

## ðŸŽ‰ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## ðŸŽ‰ System Requirements<a name = "systemrequirements"></a>
1. Operating System : Windows 7 or Higher
2. Java Version : Java 8 or Higher
3. Memory : 2GB RAM or Higher
4. Hard Disk : 200MB of free space
5. IDE : Eclipse IDE 
6. Networking : Internet connection for external services 

## ðŸŽ‰ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
This project is focused on the design and implementation of an automated teller machine (ATM) system. This system will enable customers to access their bank 
accounts and perform banking operations without the need of a bank teller. The ATM system will include a customer database, transaction logging system, and a 
security system. The system will be implemented using the object-oriented programming language Java and the Graphical User Interface (GUI) application. The 
design process and the implementation of the system are also discussed. The project will provide an efficient and secure method for customers to access and 
manage their banking accounts.

##   ðŸŽ‰ Usage <a name="usage"></a>

## ðŸŽ‰Deposit Money

This function allows  user to deposit money into their bank account through an automated teller machine (ATM). It takes two arguments, the user's bank account number and the amount of money to be deposited. 

The function first checks to make sure the user's account number is valid. If it is, it then proceeds to check if the user has sufficient funds to cover the deposit. If they do, the deposit is added to the account and the user is notified of the successful transaction. If the user does not have sufficient funds, an error message is displayed. 


This function is part of a larger automated teller machine (ATM) mini project. The full project includes other functions such as withdrawal and check balance.

## ðŸŽ‰Withdraw Money

The withdrawmoney method is a method used in an ATM Machine mini project. It is used to allow a user to withdraw money from their bank account.

This method requires the user to input their bank account details such as their account number and the amount of money they would like to withdraw. The method will then check the user's balance to ensure that the requested amount is available. If it is, the amount will be withdrawn from the user's account 


The method will also record the transaction in the bank's system to keep a record of all the transactions that have taken place. This will help the bank to keep track of the user's account and ensure that all the transactions are valid and secure.


## ðŸŽ‰Account Balance

 The account balance option is used for to check the balace of the user account
 
 The documentation for an ATM Machine mini project should include a description of the user interface and the functions that the ATM Machine can perform. It should also include a description of the database structure that is used to store account information and transaction details, along with instructions on how to manage and maintain the system.


##  ðŸŽ‰ CONCLUSION <a name="conclusion"></a>


The ATM Machine mini project was a great success. We have successfully designed and developed an application that allows users to access their bank accounts from any ATM machine. We have also ensured that the application is secure and reliable. We believe that this project will be beneficial to both customers and banks, as it will provide them with a convenient way to access their bank accounts. We are confident that this application will help to make banking easier and more efficient for everyone.
