## ðŸŽ‰ About <a name = "about"></a>
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an automated teller machine (ATM) system. An ATM is a computerized machine that provides customers 
with banking services, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, funds transfers, and account inquiries. The system is designed using the object-oriented programming 
language Java and utilizes the Graphical User Interface (GUI) application. It allows customers to access their bank accounts and perform banking operations 
without the need of a bank teller. The system also includes features such as a customer database, transaction logging system, and a security system. The project 
also discusses the design process and the implementation of the system.
